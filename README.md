Project finance master

I would like to design and build an app that encourages people to save money by budgeting and helps ensure that they are paying fair
prices and are getting the best possible deals. A lot of people today live above their means and mask rash financial decisions
that accumulate overtime and hold them back from reaching through financial freedom or prevents them from stockpiling wealth in a
significant manner. As a result of this people end up having to delay their retirement or even defaulting on loans or mess up their credit
score. 

My software is for adults who struggle with budgeting and living within their means. It is for people who want to save money and change their ways
but they need motivation and encouragement as well as reminders. It is for people who want to stop overpaying for everything but need a smart tool that will help them
do so. Also it is useful for people who do a lot of online shopping.

When the end users first start using my software it will help them create a monthly budget. They can enter in their monthly mortage payment
car note, remainder of student loans that need to be payed off as well as their monthly income. The software will use this information to
create a budget for them. Additionally, if the user chooses to the software can even divide the budget into a food budget, transportation budget, and a miscellaneous budget. 
If they do not want to enter their information they can create their own budget. The user will log their purchases. The software will show them
will show them how much of their budget they spent and how much they have remaining. It will also provide warnings when the user is close to exhausting the budget. Additionally the software will have a component that scrapes
the web for the best possible prices for a particular product. The user will enter the product name and the software will return a link to the website 
that has the best price.

This proposal is not too ambitious because it has only two major components. The budgeting component and the web scraping component. Two subteams can work on each section.
